Thus says my Lord Jehovah: It shall not occur or transpire. For as
surely as Damascus is the capital of Aram and Rezin the head of
Damascus, within sixty-five years shall Ephraim be shattered as a
nation. But as surely as Samaria is the capital of Ephraim and the
son of Remaliah the head of Samaria, you will not believe it, because
you are not loyal.</i></p>

scribal error very likely accounts for the figure “sixty-five
years.” Historically, Isaiah’s prophecy was fulfilled within just
a few years. Assyria conquered Aram and Israel during Ahaz’ reign,
so perhaps “six or five” is closer to Isaiah’s prediction. The
words “capital” and “head” (<i>ro’s</i>) are identical in
Hebrew. A play on words—“You will not believe it, because you are
not loyal” (<i>’im lo’ ta’aminu ki lo’ te’amenu</i>)—reflects
Ahaz’ disloyalty to Jehovah. Jehovah’s unconditional covenant
with David nonetheless ensures that the northern kings’ infringing
on Ahaz’ rights will suffer covenant curses.</p>
