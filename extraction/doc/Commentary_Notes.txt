1) Commentary can span multiple verses. This occurs with verse ranges or even multiple verses out of sequence from normal numbering.
2) Commentary display requires header (verse number(s) and original IIT text) and the body text(commentary).
3) Commentary text contains references to verses (OT/NT). We may wish to link to the reference text, at some point. 
4) Commentary needs a way to link verse_id to commentary_id. This would enable viewing commentary from the IIT
   4a) Mapping table would be something like map_id, verse_id, commentary_id

</span><i>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which he beheld
concerning Judea and Jerusalem during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham,
Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah:</i></p>

Verse Commentary:

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Isaiah
mentions four successive kings during whose reigns he prophesies, of
whom Ahaz and Hezekiah feature most prominently in the Book of
Isaiah, one for evil, the other for good. A fifth goes
unmentioned—Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, who slays Isaiah by
sawing him in half (<i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>,<i> </i>11:41). On
account of the sins of Manasseh, the people of the Southern Kingdom
of Judah are ultimately exiled and taken captive by the Babylonians
(2 Kings 24:3–4). Manasseh’s reign becomes a point of no return
for the Jewish nation because of the king’s corrupting influence on
the people.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	As
the preface of the Book of Isaiah, Chapter 1 dates from about 701
B.C., the fourteenth year of the reign of King Hezekiah. At that
time, Assyria invaded the Southern Kingdom of Judah. Israel’s God
Jehovah, however, thwarted Assyria’s designs because of the
righteousness of the king and his people. Earlier, in 722 B.C.,
Assyria had conquered the ten-tribed Northern Kingdom of Israel and
taken its people captive into Mesopotamia. The first chapter of the
Book of Isaiah chronologically is chapter 6, which describes Isaiah’s
calling as a prophet in the year of King Uzziah’s death in 742 B.C.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">	</font><i>The
vision. </i>Although Isaiah’s prophetic ministry may have spanned
fifty years, the singular term “vision” (<i>hazon</i>) defines
Isaiah’s writings as <i>one</i> conceptually from beginning to end.
That is evident in the Book of Isaiah’s multi-layered structuring,
through which Isaiah integrates his early oracles and later written
discourses into a single prophecy that spells out an end-time
scenario. Without taking away from the historical origins of Isaiah’s
writings, historical events now serve as an allegory of the end-time,
in which “Judea” and “Jerusalem” are codenames that designate
Jehovah’s end-time people.</p>
