        <h2>The Isaiah Institute</h2>
        <p>The Isaiah Institute was created in the year 2000 by the Hebraeus Foundation to disseminate the message of the prophet Isaiah (circa 742–701 B.C.). Avraham Gileadi Ph.D’s groundbreaking research and analysis of the Book of Isaiah provides the ideal medium for publishing Isaiah’s message to the world. No longer can the Book of Isaiah be regarded as an obscure document from a remote age. Its vibrant message, decoded after years of painstaking research by a leading authority in his field, now receives a new application as a sure guide to a rapidly changing world. To those who seek answers to today’s perplexing questions, the Book of Isaiah is God’s gift to humanity.</p>

        <h2>Avraham Gileadi Biography</h2>
        <p><img src="/images/avraham_gileadi.jpg" width="160" height="226" align="right" />Avraham Gileadi was born in the Netherlands during World War II. During the war, his father’s Dutch underground organization helped a New Zealand pilot escape to England. This led to the family emigrating to New Zealand in 1950. In 1968, Avraham Gileadi emigrated to Israel, where he learned Hebrew, attended rabbinical school, and studied Jewish analytical methods. In 1973, he moved to the United States, married and raised a family of nine children. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies under the tutelage of Professor Roland. K. Harrison of Wycliffe College, Toronto, Canada, with Professor Hugh Nibley as chairman. For his doctoral thesis (“A Bifid Division of the Book of Isaiah.” Diss., Brigham Young University, 1981), he analyzed a complex literary structure in the Book of Isaiah that radically impacts the book’s interpretation. During his Ph.D. program, he translated the text of Isaiah into modern English, with annotations from the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah, 1Qsaa, and the Greek Septuagint Version, LXX, and published it with analyses of Isaiah’s literary patterns discovered during a decade of postdoctoral research. His publications include <i>Israel’s Apostasy and Restoration: Essays in Honor of Roland K. Harrison</i> (Baker Book House, 1988); <i>The Literary Message of Isaiah</i> (Hebraeus Press, 1994; 2012); <i>The End from the Beginning: The Apocalyptic Vision of Isaiah with Isaiah Translation</i> (Hebraeus Press, 1997; 2012); <i>Isaiah Decoded: Ascending the Ladder to Heaven</i> (Hebraeus Press, 2002; 2012); the audio series <i>Analytical Commentary of Isaiah</i> (Hebraeus Press, 2006); <i>The Book of Isaiah: Analytical Translation with Comprehensive Concordance</i> (Hebraeus Press, 2012); <i>Apocalyptic Commentary of the Book of Isaiah</i> (Hebraeus Press, 2013); and <i>Windows on the Prophecy of Isaiah: Study Tools for Understanding Isaiah</i> (Hebraeus Press, 2015).</p>
